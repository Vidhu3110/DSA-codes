/*
    graph data structure
    2 types of graph
        1. Directed
        2. Undirected

    1. Directed :
    indegree and outdegree == sum of edges == |E|

    max no of edges  = |V| *(|V|-1);

    2. Undirected:
    sum of degree = 2*|E|;
        max no of edges  = (|V| *(|V|-1))/2;


    walk = v1 v2 v4 v2
    path = v1 v2 v4 --- no repeated edges or vertices
    cyclic : there exist a walk that begins and end with the same vertex
    Acyclic : does not contain a cycle


weighted and unweigthed graphs::
